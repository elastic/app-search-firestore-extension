Use this extension to export the documents in a Cloud Firestore collection to [Elastic App Search](https://www.elastic.co/app-search/) and keep them in sync.

Indexing your data into App Search lets you easily add [full-text search](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/solutions/search) to your Firebase application.

App Search doesn't just enable basic full-text search either, it gives all of the tools you need to build full-featured search experiences. You'll have a full API for implementing common search patterns like auto-completed search suggestions and faceted filter navigation. You'll also have dashboard lets your team easily track and tweak search relevance based on actual customer usage data.

##### Indexing

This extension will keep a Cloud Firestore collection synced to an App Search [Engine](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-app-search-engine) by creating a Cloud Function which syncs changes in your collection on any [write event](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/firestore-events#function_triggers); meaning any time you create, update, or a delete a document.

##### Backfilling

Since you'll likely have documents created in your collection already, this extension also provides a [script](https://github.com/elastic/app-search-firestore-extension/tree/master/functions/src/bin) for backfilling existing data to App Search.

##### Searching

Once your data synced to App Search, you'll be able to use the App Search [Search API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/search.html), which provides not only the ability to perform full-text search, but everything you need to build a complete search experience; facets, filters, click analytics, query suggestion, relevance tuning and much more.

#### Additional setup

##### Create a target for this extension

You'll need an [Elastic Enterprise Search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/installation.html) (of which App Search is part of) instance set up, which will be created and maintained outside of Firestore. You can either create one on Elastic's [cloud](https://www.elastic.co/) or host it yourself. You'll then need to gather credentials and information from the deployment to configure this extension.

##### Create a source for this extension

You'll need to have an existing Firebase project created that includes a Firestore Collection.

<!-- We recommend keeping the following section to explain how billing for Firebase Extensions works -->

#### Billing
 
To install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)
 
- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).
- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the serviceâ€™s free tier:
  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. See [FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-24))
  - Cloud Firestore
  - Cloud Secret Manager

If you host your Elastic Enterprise Search instance on Elastic Cloud, you will also be responsible for charges associated with that service.
