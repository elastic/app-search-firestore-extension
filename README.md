# Elastic App Search extension for Firestore

This extension syncs data from Google's [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) to [Elastic App Search](https://www.elastic.co/app-search/).

Out-of-the-box, Cloud Firestore provides no mechanism for full-text search on data. Syncing your Cloud Firestore data to Elastic App Search not only gives you a mechanism for full-text search on your data, it also lets you enjoy App Search's powerful relevance tuning features and search analytics data.
